# OptimizationME575
Repo for the homework and projects of ME575 at BYU in MATLAB
## Description of Homeworks
Hw1 - This homework was to to optimize a simple problem using fmincon.

Hw2 - This homework was to optimize a much more complicated problem than Hw1.

Hw3 - This homework was to write two optimization algorithms, steepest descent and a Quasi-Newton method. It was up to us to determine the line search methods and inverse hessian update methods.

Hw4 - This homework involved estimating our own derivatives. The methods were: forward difference, central difference, or complex step, and automatic differentiation.

Hw5 - This homework was to implement simulated annealing and find the best parameters for the simulated annealing algorithm to solve a certain problem.

Hw6 - This homework was to solve the KKT conditions of various problems.

Hw7 - This homework was to do one or two steps of the Sequential Quadratic Programming Alogrithm and the Interior Point Algorithm.

Project1 - This project was to come up with an interesting problem and solve it with gradient based optimization. We chose a truss problem with a roller joint and a fixed joint. We minimized weight while meeting stress and buckling conditions.

Project2 - Thie project was to come up with an interesting problem and solve it with a genetic algorithm. It was a complex project and is described more in its own README file.
